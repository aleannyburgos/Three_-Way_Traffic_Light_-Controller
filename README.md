# Three_-Way_Traffic_Light_-Controller
The purpose of this project was to implement a three-way traffic light configuration using FSM design.

## Task
There is a three-way intersection that has a traffic light the North, South and east side. For all the traffic lights, there is red yellow and green lights. Additionally, for the cars heading east, there is another light specifically for cars turning right and for the cars heading north there is a green light for cars turning left. There are three different times intervals:
  1) m = 20 secs, for when the lights are EG, NR and SR
  2) d = 10 secs, for the yellow lights
  3) M = 60 secs, for all the other stages

The task here is to design a finite state machine to transition from the different states
